    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy
      Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose information through our
      iOS mobile application Aisten (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>
      We do not collect any personal information from users of our App. The App
      does not require any user registration or account creation.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>

    <p>
      We do not collect any personal data such as your name, email address,
      phone number, photos, location information, or any other identifiers. The
      App also does not access your contact list or calendar on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Information</h2>

    <p>
      As we do not collect any personal information, there is no user data that
      we use or share with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>

    <p>
      The App allows users to purchase access to premium content and features
      through in-app purchases. Any transactions are processed by the Apple App
      Store's payment system, not by us, so we do not receive or store any
      payment information.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      Our App does not knowingly collect personal information from children
      under 13. If we learn that personal information of a child under 13 has
      been collected, we will take steps to delete such information.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>
      As the App does not collect or store any user information, specific
      security measures are not applicable. However, we take care to release
      updates and bug fixes for the App as needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also
      revise the "Last Updated" date below. We recommend you periodically review
      this Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal
      information we collect. Your continued use of the App constitutes your
      agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.
    </p>
